<h4>DEVELOPMENTAL RATIONALE</h4>
<p>Students in the forth grade are a variety of different developmental ranges. They are beginning to become much more social, note gender differences, and express their identity. Though the creation of their own personal paradise they are expressing that identity as well as create a piece of art that is planned out, realistic but expressive. At this age they are comparing their work to ideals and their skills do not match their thought process, be combining the realistic with the imaginary and abstract a balance of skill and expression is achieved. Students in this stage are moving away from the concrete toward interpretation and the abstract. In terms of drawing they are becoming more interested in observation and their schema are disappearing, proportions and perspective become more apparent, a visual realism is wanted. Students will be exploring materials, letting them choose which will work best for the idea they are expressing. Through an exploration of mark making students are combining their want for realistic imagery with emotional expression.</p>

<h4>UNIT OBJECTIVE</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Students will explore expressive mark making. They will translate these marks and discoveries into multiple prints, including mono-prints and styrofoam reliefs, of their own paradise. Using abstract marks and forms they will add meaning to their imagined landscape.</li>
		<li>Students will explore and experiment with new printmaking processes and expressive mark making.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>THE UNIT PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
<p>What would your perfect world look like, your own personal paradise? How can you express this utopia through mark making?</p>

<h4>GUIDING QUESTIONS</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>How do you express an emotion through abstract mark making?</li>
		<li>What do you think a happy mark looks like? or a loud mark? or a slow mark?</li>
		<li>What would your perfect place, your paradise, look like?</li>
		<li>What kinds of marks can you use to express this place?</li>
		<li>How does the process of creating a drawing for a print differ from just creating a drawing?</li>
		<li>How does this printmaking process differ from the last, the mono-print we made last week?</li>
		<li>What are the differences between the two prints we created today (the additive and subtractive)?</li>

	</ul>
<h4>THE HOWARD COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM, THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ART PROGRAM: (Intermediate, grades 4-5)</h4>
<h5>CONCEPTS based upon the elements of art and the principles of design:</h5>
	<ul>
    	<li>Line - Lines may be used to emphasize a center of interest, can show texture, can be distorted to abstract and simplify forms</li>
		<li>Color - Color can be used for emphasis in a composition, can express mood and meaning</li>
		<li>Texture - Texture can be used to create surface variety</li>
	</ul>
<h5>PRINTMAKING:</h5>
	<ul>
    	<li>(emerging intermediate) apply printmaking processes to transfer imagery that incorporates the formal qualities of art</li>
    	<li>use printmaking processes and materials to develop a series of images, which express individual ideas, thoughts, and feelings</li>
    </ul>
<h5>RESPONDING:</h5>
	<ul>
    	<li>demonstrate the ability to analyze and evaluate the characteristics of artworks</li>
    </ul>
<h5>EXPRESSING:</h5>
	<ul>
    	<li>develop the ability to organize new and prior knowledge and ideas with tools and media for self-expression</li>
    </ul>
<h5>INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (grades 4-5) Making Artistic Choices:</h5>
    <p>“Emphasis for the learner at this instruction level is on creating meaning, making decisions, and aesthetic judgements. The child becomes an artist able to make choices about materials, processes, and techniques, strengthening their problem solving ability. This young artist continues to expand his/her visual and verbal vocabulary through drawing from memory, using the narrative to tell stories, and observation. In preparation for middle-school, the student develops representational skills, and establishes criteria for self-evaluation.”
    use a variety of media to reflect personal decisions and experiences
    follow multi-step process to solve an art problem</p>

<h4>VOCABULARY</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>expressionism: a style of art in which the artist seeks to express emotional experience rather than impressions of the external world.</li>
		<li>abstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence </li>
		<li>exploration: examine or evaluate, inquire into in order to learn about or familiarize oneself with</li>
		<li>utopia: an imagined place or state of things in which everything is perfect.  </li>
		<li>paradise: an ideal or idyllic place</li>
		<li>horizon line, foreground, middle ground, background</li>
		<li>transfer: convey (a drawing or design) from one surface to another.</li>
		<li>mono-print: a print made by a process that allows for only one impression to be pulled. Generally, the artist creates an image by drawing or painting it on a surface from which it can be transferred/printed onto a piece of paper</li>
		<li>additive: characterized or produced by addition of a material</li>
		<li>subtractive: The act of removing material or media</li>
