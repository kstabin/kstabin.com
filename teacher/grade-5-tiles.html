    </ul>

<h4>THE UNIT PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>

		<li>What colors would you use to represent something happy? sad? an emotion</li>
	</ul>

<h4>CONCEPTS AND SKILLS</h4>
<h5>CONCEPTS:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Student will express their identity through the designing of a personal symbol</li>
		<li>Students will understand what a symbol is and what symbols represent themselves</li>
		<li>Students will use visual imagery to create symbols for who they are and what they want others to see about them</li>
		<li>Students will express their personality and their likes and hobbies through 3d visual representation</li>
		<li>Students will understand the difference between high and low relief</li>
		<li>Students will express themselves and their emotions through the colors they use to paint their personal symbol tiles</li>
	</ul>
<h5>SKILLS:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Students will learn the properties of clay and how to use the material to create their visual vocabulary</li>
		<li>Students will create 3d representations of objects</li>
		<li>Students will create relief sculptures using techniques in high and low relief</li>
		<li>Students will paint a 3d surface</li>
	</ul>
<h5>DISPOSITIONS:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Students will be open to express their feeling and emotions</li>
		<li>Students will open to experimenting and learning about new materials and techniques</li>
		<li>Students will be constructive in their criticisms and willing to change or make their ideas better</li>
		<li>Student’s works will be done to the best of their abilities and they will always be considering the craftsmanship of what they are creating</li>
	</ul>

<h4>DEVELOPMENTAL RATIONALE</h4>
<p>Students at this grade become concerned with their identity, how they are seen be themselves, their peers and anyone around them. Their personality is being established and they are becoming aware to it. Symbolic representation becomes coherent, they have an interest in classification and generalization. A process of decentering begins where they are establishing themselves, but establishing themselves among others and in comparison to others. Children are able to consider other’s point of view and compare it with their own.</p> 
<p>At this age one of the reasons for creating art becomes more about the materials and visual communication. Sometimes the skills of the child do not match their thought process. Student’s thought process move away from a concrete representation of symbols towards a desire to interpret and reproduce objects. Students are able to work cooperatively with peers, and can now fully control their behavior but become easily influenced by the behaviors of their peers. </p>
<p>At this stage the artistic product becomes more important. Students have a love of humor and dramatization but also a level of uncertainty, in a transition from elementary to middle school, from childhood to adulthood. Children ages 9-11 are in Lowenfeld’s stage of drawing realism, where they are focusing on one perspective, their lines become more realistic, there is a diversity of plane, and cooperation in group work. </p>

<h5>CONCEPTS based on the element of art:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Line - Line can be used to show surface detail, organize a composition</li>
		<li>Shape - Shapes can be geometric or amorphous, varied in size to emphasize a center of interest, can be used to define positive or negative space</li>
		<li>Color - Colors can be used for emphasis in a composition, can express mood and meaning, can be used to unify a composition</li>

	</ul>
<h5>INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (grades 4-5) Making Artistic Choices</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>“Emphasis for the learner at this instructional level is on creating meaning, making decisions, and aesthetic judgements. The child becomes an artist able to make choices about materials, processes and techniques, strengthening their problem solving ability. This young artist continues to expand his/her visual and verbal vocabulary through drawing from memory, using the narrative to tell stories, and observation. In preparation for middle school, the students develops representational skills and establishes criteria for self-evaluation.”</li>
