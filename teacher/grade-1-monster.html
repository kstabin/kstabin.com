<h4>DEVELOPMENTAL RATIONALE</h4>
	<p>Students in the first grade are developing their fine motor skills and distinguishing between 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional space and form. They are beginning to understand symbolism, such as the monster they create representing the things that they are afraid of. Student’s art is showing simple realism and conscious decisions about color choices. The narrative element of the art is more important then the product, the story of a monster being in their closet is more intriguing then what that monster looks like. Students at this age are egocentric, they are expressing their own personal fears and their own personal monster. Students draw what they know and not what they see and tend to exaggerate, drawing from imagination comes easier to these students.
