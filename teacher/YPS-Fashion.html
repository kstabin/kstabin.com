<h3>"Introduction to Fashion Design"</h3>
<p>Grades 6-8</p>
<p>Sept, 2011</p>

<h6>For the fashion savvy young artist, this course introduces students to the world of style! Students explore fashion design concepts through sketching, fabric selection and design, color combinations, pattern design, and use of textures in garments. Beyond designing clothing items, students also consider fashion trends, past and present, in order to create garments, accessories, hats, and other innovative wearables that push the boundaries of existing styles. After guiding students through the basic vocabulary and skills needed to be successful fashion designers, students are presented with challenges and clients for whom they must design original creations for specific purposes.</h6>
