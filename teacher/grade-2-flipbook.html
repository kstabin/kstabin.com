<h4>UNIT OBJECTIVE</h4>
    <p>Students will construct flip books telling a story about an important event that has happened in their lives or something that they wish would happen in their lives while exploring ideas of movement and narrative art making</p>

<h4>THE UNIT PROBLEM STATEMENT</h4>
	<ul>
    	<li>How do you tell a story about something in your life through a series of “moving” images?</li>
    	<li>What is the most important event that has happened in your life? What would you like to happen?</li>
    </ul>

<h4>GUIDING QUESTIONS</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>How do you create a moving picture?</li>
	    <li>How do you tell a story through a series of connected images?</li>
	    <li>What is the most important event that has happened in your life?</li>
	    <li>What is something you wish would happen in your life?</li>
	    <li>How will you keep your images consistent but still move your story forward?</li>
	    <li>Does your completed flip book portray the action and story you were trying to tell?</li>
	    <li>Can you tell what story is being told in the flip book?</li>
	    <li>How do you put together a book?</li>
	    <li>How do you illustrate a story, tell a story without using words?</li>
