<h3>Child First Art Core</h3>
<h3>"After School Art"</h3>
<p>Elementary</p>
<p>Oct, 2011</p>

<h4>Child First Authority, Inc.</h4>
<h5>Baltimore, MD</h5>
<p>Child First Authority (CFA) provides funding to (1) organize high quality, after school and in-school programs in Baltimore City Public Schools, (2) organize parents, school staff, and community partners to act on their vision of a brighter future for BCPS children. CFA was established in 1996 in response to a community organizing campaign by its founding partner BUILD (Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development).  Hundreds of citizens expressed the need for safe space, academic achievement, and opportunity for children in Baltimore City Schools.</p>

<h4>Child First Art Core</h4>
<p>Background: Baltimore has a thriving visual and performing arts scene but many Baltimore City Schools lack resources to provide high quality arts programs to students on a daily basis. Child First Art Core was created to provide art resources to students in Child First partner schools and link the arts community to city schools. Art Core teaching artists are local, professional artists who want to create artwork with students in Child First schools. The role of CFA partner schools is to support teaching artists with necessary resources and skills to work with elementary/middle school students and successfully create quality artwork to display in Child First annual art show.</p>
<p>Purpose: Art Core teaching artists will use an art medium to explore age appropriate topics and community issues in Child First partner schools. Art Core provides youth an opportunity to express their ideas and concerns by exploring creative artistic mediums such as music, poetry, performance, video, drawing, sculpture, and design. The process of creating art will increase student leadership, communication skills, creative thinking, public speaking, teambuilding skills, social awareness and self-confidence.</p>
