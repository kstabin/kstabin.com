<h4>LEARNER</h4>
<p>Sixth grade reading class at Mt. Royal Elementary/Middle School, Baltimore City, MD. Class 601, 27 students all African American, about half female and half male. Most are new to the school, have transferred from a different elementary school to middle school. Most have scored passing on the MSA’s but there are some special education students in the class (learning disabilities, not physical). The students are grouped into classes through a tracking system based on their scores on the MSA’s, since this class in number 601 they are the lowest preforming class of sixth graders. </p>

<h4>DEVELOPMENTAL RATIONALE</h4>
<p>Students in the sixth grade, ages 11 to 12 years old, are at a developmental stage where their physical, social and cognitive elements are all fighting with each other. Developmentally they are facing the big concerns of identity, power dynamics, transition and metamorphosis, rebellion, and each student is at different level of this development. Socially they are dealing with their social identity, themselves as a individual within the whole, their interior versus their exterior, community, and independence. Students at this stage are “establishing their own identities and becoming individuals” and “friends become even more significant to them” (Smith). Their development is being influenced by popular visual cultural and technology. </p>
<p>Students artistic development at this stage is one of pseudo-realism stage of reasoning (Lowenfeld) or concrete operational (Piaget). Students focus on realistic approaches, the importance of the art product, develop spatial effects and emotional color use, and begin to implement various techniques to solve problems. Students interpersonal relationships become cooperative and they are de-centered and can perceive other’s viewpoints. Children begin to be grouped as visual or non-visual, and develop a sense of incompetence. They are uncertain, being in a stage between childhood and adulthood. </p>
<p>Also artistically, students are more comfortable with contour line and surface textures, become more specific and detailed, understand viewpoint and spatial relationships, and are able to make choices about using various materials. (Smith).</p>
<p>I have chosen this art activity because it connects art making with student’s personal fears which gives them a personal connection to the piece and a way to relate to what they are creating. It addresses student’s identity, they are defining themselves by what they are afraid of but at the same time overcoming that fear. By drawing from an ink blot students have a starting point for creating their image, they do not have to create the entire image from their imagination, which developmentally would be difficult at this age, but only parts of it. It also gives them an opportunity to focus on details and specific aspects of their drawing. By limiting the materials being used students are challenged to come up with successful means for representing their ideas with what they are provided with, and they learn how to technically master the materials because they are forced to use them. Through creation of a visual metaphor for a personal fear, student’s art works are connected to their own emotions as well as being connected to the content being covered in the class, the poem Jabberwocky. By reflectively writing about their art works they are reinforcing their ideas as well as coming up with solutions for how to overcome their own fears. </p>

<h4>ENVIRONMENT/CLIMATE</h4>
<p>Mt. Royal is a K-8, inner city urban school, a distinguished title one school, with a 99% African American population and 80% of the students being eligible for free lunch. There are 826 students, with an average class size of 24, there are 35 full-time teachers.</p>
<p>The school has an environment of test preparation and busy work and silent independent learning. The teacher is a guide for what worksheets need to be filled out and what pages need to be read, creative teaching and learning is hard to come by. Art is not a class that all students take, if they do it may only be once in the three years they are there, for a quarter of that year. The school has in place a arts integration program, I have not seen the program at work, and think that even these lessons happen on rare occasions and only a few times a year. The classroom itself is packed with furniture and hard to navigate through. The teacher stands at the front of the room and the students sit at desks arranged in groups of u’s. There is no area of the room for everyone to gather in, they stay at a seat and that is the only place they will be for the entire class. The students are somewhat social, they are in middle school so the social element is developmentally inherent, but seats are always being changed and students rearranged to stop the talking or distractions. </p>

<h4>INTERDISCIPLINARY RATIONALE</h4>
<p>Through this lesson reading skills are emphasized through the exploration of the poetic form and the understanding of inference of unknown. Students are expanding their knowledge of vocabulary and skills of translating meanings of words. Through structured grammar related worksheets where they are asked to identify parts of speech and discover meaning of unknown words, students are concretely applying their knowledge of reading. Through further exploration of the poem they are expanding that concrete knowledge into the abstract, creating meaning and rewording content to comprehend understanding completely. They also further explore reading content through writing. They are able to transfer the knowledge they have acquired through exploration, to their own personal reflective writing which includes elements taken directly from the literature read. Through invention of their own nonsense words they are further understanding Carroll’s reason’s for including them within his poem, as well as exploring how to use these ideas to express their own personal feeling and experiences in an imaginative manner.</p>
<p>With the use of character development sketching, students are expanding their understanding of meaning into the visual. By representing the characters within the poem in the visual form they are further creating meaning for the poem and the visual learners in the class are beginning to see the poem much clearer. </p>
<p>Though the translation of the meaning of poem to the personal individual idea of fears and facing obstacles, students are able to further understand the meaning of the poem while exploring their own personal emotions and characteristics. The artistic element of representing this fear translates the students idea into a concrete visual form which serves as a metaphor for that fear. Through representing this fear with the artistic process of ink blot creature drawings, students are able to use imagination and inventiveness as well as not having the pressure of having to draw realistically and accurately. The students are learning that art does not have to be realistic object representations, and that everyone is able to create art. They are learning visual metaphors, extension of mark making, and imaginative and narrative drawing skills. </p>

<h4>UNIT OBJECTIVE</h4>
<p>Students will develop an understanding and analysis of the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll. They will develop connections between the poem Jabberwocky and their own personal fears as well as how to overcome these fears as the character in the poem did. </p>

<h4>UNIT ART PROBLEM</h4>
<p>Students will create imagined creatures/monsters from ink blots that are metaphors for personal fears or obstacles that they wish to overcome. They will connect their personal experiences with those from the poem Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll. Student will reflect on their monster and how they can conquer this fear, through writing. </p>
